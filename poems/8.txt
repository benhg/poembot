Little Boy Blue
by Eugene Field (1850-1895)


The little toy dog is covered
  with dust,
But sturdy and stanch
  he stands;
And the little toy soldier is
  red with rust,
And his musket moulds in his
  hands.
Time was when the little toy
  dog was new,
And the soldier was
  passing fair;
And that was the time when our
  Little Boy Blue
Kissed them and put them there.


"Now, don't you go
  till I come," he said,
"And don't you make any noise!"
So, toddling off to his
  trundle-bed,
He dreamt of the pretty toys;
And, as he was dreaming, an
  angel song
Awakened our Little Boy Blue--
Oh! the years are many,
  the years are long,
But the little toy friends
  are true!


Ay, faithful to Little Boy Blue
  they stand,
Each in the same old place---
Awaiting the touch of a
  little hand,
The smile of a little face;
And they wonder, as waiting the
  long years through
In the dust of that
  little chair,
What has become of our
   Little Boy Blue,
Since he kissed them
   and put them there.
