The Wind Sleepers
H. D.


Whiter 
than the crust
 left by the tide,
 we are stung by the hurled sand
 and the broken shells.


We no longer sleep
 in the wind-
 we awoke and fled
 through the city gate.


Tear-
tear us an altar,
 tug at the cliff-boulders,
 pile them with the rough stones-
 we no longer
 sleep in the wind, 
propitiate us.


Chant in a wail 
that never halts,
 pace a circle and pay tribute
 with a song.


When the roar of a dropped wave 
breaks into it,
 pour meted words
 of sea-hawks and gull 
sand sea-birds that cry
 discords.
