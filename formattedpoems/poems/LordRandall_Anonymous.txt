"Oh where ha'e ye been, Lord
Randall my son?
O where ha'e ye been, my hand-

For I'm weary wi' hunting, and
fain wald lie down."


“Where gat ye your dinner,
Lord Randall my son?
Where gat ye your dinner, my

 "I dined wi' my true love;
mother, make my bed soon,
For I'm weary wi' hunting, and
fain wald lie down."


"What gat ye to your dinner,
Lord Randall my son?
What gat ye to your dinner,
my handsome young man?"
"I gat eels boiled in broo:
mother, make my bed soon,
For I'm weary wi' hunting, and
fain wald lie down."


"What became of your
  bloodhounds,
Lord Randall my son?
What became of your
  bloodhounds,
my handsome young man?"
"O they swelled and they died:
mother, make my bed soon,
for I'm weary wi' hunting, and
fain wald lie down."


"O I fear ye are poisoned, Lord
Randall my son!
O I fear ye are poisoned, my
handsome young man!"
"O yes, I am poisoned: mother,
make my bed soon,
For I'm sick
  at the heart, and I
fain wald lie down."
