Fantasy
Gwendolyn Bennett


I sailed in my dreams
  to the Land of Night
Where you were
  the dusk-eyed queen,
And there in the pallor
  of moon-veiled light
The loveliest things
  were seen ...


A slim-necked peacock
  sauntered there
In a garden of lavender hues,
And you were strange with your
  purple hair
As you sat in your
  amethyst chair
With your feet in your
  hyacinth shoes


Oh, the moon gave a
  bluish light
Through the trees in the land
  of dreams and night.
I stood behind a bush of
  yellow-green
And whistled a song to the
  dark-haired queen ...
