Mother
Lola Ridge


Your love was like moonlight
turning harsh things to beauty,
so that little wry souls
reflecting each other obliquely
as in cracked mirrors...
beheld in your luminous spirit
their own reflection,
transfigured
  as in a shining stream,
and loved you
  for what they are not.


You are
  less an image in my mind
than a luster
I see you in gleams
pale as star-light
  on a gray wall...
evanescent as the reflection
  of a white swan
shimmering in broken water.
